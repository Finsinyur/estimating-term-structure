# estimating-term-structure
A simple exercise applying methods to construct interest rate term structure.
This exercise is based on a coursera course "Interest Rate Models" by Damir Filipovic, and this is a documentation of my attempt to solving the problem using python programming with the knowledge taught in this course.
